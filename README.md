# Sorting_Network_DRL
Sorting Network Solver Using Deep Reinforcement Learning.


This project employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to tackle the sorting network problem. By leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and a custom-built environment with a reward system, the project aims to identify optimal sorting network configurations.
